- **Idle timeout policies** - Automatic resource cleanup
- **Spending limits** - Budget management per team/user
- **Retention policies** - Automatic deletion of unused environments

### Security & Compliance
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Integrate with existing identity provider
- **Encrypted at rest and in transit**
- **Network restrictions** - IP allowlisting
- **Secrets management** - Centralized, encrypted secrets

---

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot (Weeks 1-4)
- Select pilot team (5-10 developers)
- Create standard .devcontainer templates
- Establish governance policies
- Monitor usage and gather feedback

### Phase 2: Rollout (Weeks 5-12)
- Expand to additional teams
- Refine templates based on feedback
- Implement organization policies
- Training and documentation

### Phase 3: Full Adoption (Weeks 13+)
- Organization-wide deployment
- Advanced governance features
- Cost optimization
- Continuous improvement

---

## Cost Model

### Simple, Predictable Pricing
- **Standard developer**: ~$30-50/month (2-core, 40 hrs/week)
- **Power developer**: ~$100-150/month (4-core, heavy usage)
- **Automatic idle shutdown** after 30 minutes saves 70% costs
- **Monthly caps** prevent budget overruns

---

## Platform Options

### Available Solutions

| Platform | Best For | Cost Model | Key Advantage |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **GitHub Codespaces** | Quick start, GitHub users | $0.18/hour | Already included with GitHub |
| **Gitpod** | Self-hosted but managed | $8/mo + usage | 3-minute AWS setup, zero ops |
| **DevZero** | Cost optimization | $40/user/month | 90% cost savings with MicroVMs |
| **Coder** | Full on-premises control | License + infrastructure | Complete data residency |

### Recommendation: Phased Approach
1. **Start with Codespaces** - Already included, immediate value
2. **Evaluate Gitpod** - If need self-hosted without management burden
3. **Consider DevZero** - If costs become concern at scale
4. **Deploy Coder** - Only if strict on-premises requirement

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Implementation
1. **Pilot** (Month 1): 10 developers, non-sensitive projects
2. **Expand** (Month 2-3): Department-level rollout
3. **Scale** (Month 4+): Enterprise deployment with governance

### Data Access Solutions
- **Non-sensitive**: Direct cloud development
- **Sensitive**: VPN tunnel to on-premises databases
- **Restricted**: Consider Coder for full on-premises
