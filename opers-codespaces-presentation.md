---

## Governance Through .devcontainer

### Standardization at Scale
```json
{
  "name": "OPERS Python Development",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
      "version": "3.11"
    }
  },
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
        "ms-python.black-formatter"
      ]
    }
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
}
```

### Benefits
- **Enforced environment standards**
- **Pre-approved tools and extensions**
- **Consistent Python versions and dependencies**
- **Security scanning built-in**

---

## Shadow IT Mitigation

### Current Shadow IT Risks
- ❌ Local development on personal machines
- ❌ Unapproved cloud IDEs
- ❌ Data leakage through unsecured environments
- ❌ Inconsistent security practices

### Codespaces Solution
- ✅ **Centralized development** - All work in controlled cloud environment
- ✅ **No local code** - Source code never leaves secure perimeter
- ✅ **Audit trails** - Complete logging of all activities
- ✅ **Policy enforcement** - Organization-wide security policies

---

## Enterprise Governance Features

### Organization-Level Controls
- **Machine types restrictions** - Control compute resources
- **Idle timeout policies** - Automatic resource cleanup
- **Spending limits** - Budget management per team/user
- **Retention policies** - Automatic deletion of unused environments

### Security & Compliance
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Integrate with existing identity provider
- **Encrypted at rest and in transit**
- **Network restrictions** - IP allowlisting
- **Secrets management** - Centralized, encrypted secrets

---

## Developer Experience

### For Python Developers
- **Instant setup** - No local configuration required
- **Pre-configured Python environments**
- **Full VSCode experience** - Extensions, debugging, terminals
- **GPU support available** - For ML/Data Science workloads

### Productivity Benefits
- **60-second environment spin-up**
- **Branch-specific environments**
- **Collaborate through Live Share**
- **Works from any device with a browser**

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot (Weeks 1-4)
- Select pilot team (5-10 developers)
- Create standard .devcontainer templates
- Establish governance policies
- Monitor usage and gather feedback

### Phase 2: Rollout (Weeks 5-12)
- Expand to additional teams
- Refine templates based on feedback
- Implement organization policies
- Training and documentation

### Phase 3: Full Adoption (Weeks 13+)
- Organization-wide deployment
- Advanced governance features
- Cost optimization
- Continuous improvement

---

## Cost Management

### Transparent Pricing Model
- **2-core:** $0.18/hour
- **4-core:** $0.36/hour  
- **8-core:** $0.72/hour
- **16-core:** $1.44/hour
- **32-core:** $2.88/hour
- **Storage:** $0.07/GB per month
- **Note:** GitHub Enterprise Cloud does not include free Codespaces quota
- **Source:** [GitHub Docs - Codespaces Billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces)

### Cost Controls
- Set spending limits per user/team
- Automatic stop on idle (configurable)
- Usage reports and analytics
- Prebuild optimization

---

## Alternative: Coder (Brief Overview)

### When to Consider Coder
- Self-hosted requirement
- Air-gapped environments
- Custom infrastructure needs
- Multi-cloud deployment

### Trade-offs
- ❌ Additional infrastructure management
- ❌ Separate licensing costs
- ❌ Not integrated with GitHub Enterprise
- ✅ More customization options
- ✅ Self-hosted control

**Recommendation:** Start with Codespaces (already included), evaluate Coder if specific self-hosted requirements emerge

---

## Demo Scenarios

### 1. Environment Creation
- Create new Codespace from repository
- Show .devcontainer configuration
- Demonstrate instant Python environment

### 2. Governance Controls
- Organization settings walkthrough
- Policy enforcement demonstration
- Cost management dashboard

### 3. Developer Workflow
- Python development workflow
- Debugging capabilities
- Extension marketplace (curated)
- Terminal access and pip installations

### 4. Security Features
- Secrets management
- Network restrictions
- Audit logs review

---

## Key Differentiators

### Why Codespaces for OPERS?

1. **Already Included** - No additional procurement needed
2. **GitHub Integration** - Seamless workflow with existing repos
3. **Enterprise Ready** - SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP certified
4. **Developer Friendly** - Familiar VSCode experience
5. **IT Governance** - Centralized control and visibility

---

## Shadow IT Solutions Summary

### Problems Solved
✅ **Visibility** - All development in monitored environment
